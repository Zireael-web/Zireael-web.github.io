The project is hosted on GitHub server. Here I practiced all the necessary JS knowledge(Functions, Events, DOM, AJAX, Localstorage, Regular Expressions and so on), JSON, Webpack, Babel. With these instruments I made a calculator, slider, timer, modal window, forms, tabs.

Markup is not mine, though, and I didn't have the layout, so the site isn't adaptive one. I only created scripts.
